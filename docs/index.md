## Introduction

[TRON FACTORY](http://39.106.174.213/kangjiancheng/tron-factory) is a one-click chaining solution that helps you quickly build a more stable and secure production-level blockchain environment, reducing the challenges of blockchain deployment, operations, management, application development, etc. You are more focused on core business innovation and fast business.

## Preparation

You need to install [node](https://nodejs.org/), [yarn](https://yarn.bootcss.com/docs/install/#mac-stable), [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [maven](http://maven.apache.org/) locally.（Recommend the current official website stable version, do not use the old version of Node, otherwise the project can not start normally).  
Front end of this project is based on [ES2015+](https://es6.ruanyifeng.com/), [vue](https://cn.vuejs.org/index.html), [vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/zh-cn/), [vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/zh-cn/), [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) , [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) and [element-ui](https://github.com/ElemeFE/element).  
Backend end of this project is based on [sprint-boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), [maven](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/index.html) and [lightbend](https://github.com/lightbend/config).  
Learning this knowledge in advance will make a greate help in this project.
