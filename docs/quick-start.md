# Quick start

Need to implement SSH in advance [key login](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-ssh-key-based-authentication-on-a-linux-server) or [password login](https://serverpilot.io/docs/how-to-enable-ssh-password-authentication/) 

Deploy node needs [java-tron-1.0.0.zip build](https://tronprotocol.github.io/documentation-en/developers/deployment/)

## Blockchain configuration

The blockchain configuration is the configuration of the basic information of the private chain to be deployed, and the blockchain configuration will not be able to be edited or deleted after nodes are added.

### basic configuration

The required fields include:

|              Name               |              Description              |
| :---------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------: |
|                BlockchainName                |             The unique identification of the private chain             |
|                Signature algorithm                | ECkey(Secp256k1) or SM2  |
|                  p2pVersion	                  |                P2P version of the private chain                |

### Genesis account

The genesis account includes a Blackhole account by default and must contain at least one genesis account to ensure that transactions can be made on the private chain.

The required fields include:

|              Name               |              Description              |

### Node Details

Click `details` to view the details of the node.

### Edit node

On the node details page, users can click `Edit` to edit nodes that are not deployed. After the node is deployed, editing operations will not be available.

### Delete node

On the node details page, users can click `Delete` to delete nodes that are not deployed. After the node is deployed, the deletion operation will not be available.

When the last node is deleted, it means that the current chain is deleted and the system will automatically switch to the home page, pending the user to re-initialize the chain information.

## Configuration

Configuration is to modify the configuration file of node deployment.You can learn the field details of configuration file by [main_net_config.conf](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tron-deployment/blob/master/main_net_config.conf).

### Fast config

Fast configuration is to modify only the deployed file genesis block information and P2P information while other configurations use the default configuration.For more configuration you can choose custom config.

#### Module customization

Include two modules:consensus module and transaction module

#### Consensus module

Currently supports DPOS

#### transaction module

You can upload your own compiled transaction module.

## Launch Nodes

TRON FACTORY only support deploy all nodes at one time.Nodes which deployment status are pending will be deployed when clicking deploy button. 

You will choose deployment files of java-tron after click deploy button.See [depolyment document](https://tronprotocol.github.io/documentation-en/developers/deployment/) to learn how to compile java-tron and generate deployment files.

All the nodes will be deployed in turn after click deploy button.You can check logs after the deployment is complete and the status of nodes will change to complete.

### Logs

Click logs to view the log of the node's deployment. 

## Help

> [1] Note: Click the `start` button is meant to start dveploying your private-chain.   
> [2] Note: The signature algorithm cannot be changed once the node has been added.And only after the node is emptied the signature algorithm can be reselected.  
> [3] Note: The range of voteCount is 0 - 9223372036854775807.  
> [4] Note: The balance range is between -9223372036854775808 and 9223372036854775807. To ensure successful deployment, please fill in the range of values.  
> [5] Note：Blackhole asset is required and different signature algorithm corresponding to different address.  
> [6] Note: Need to fill in the corresponding address of the current signature algorithm.
