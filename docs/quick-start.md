# Quick start

Need to implement SSH in advance [key login](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-ssh-key-based-authentication-on-a-linux-server) or [password login](https://serverpilot.io/docs/how-to-enable-ssh-password-authentication/) 

Deploy node needs [java-tron-1.0.0.zip build](https://tronprotocol.github.io/documentation-en/developers/deployment/)

## Blockchain configuration

The blockchain configuration is the configuration of the basic information of the private chain to be deployed, and the blockchain configuration will not be able to be edited or deleted after nodes are added.

### basic configuration

The required fields include:

|              Name               |              Description              |
| :---------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------: |
|                BlockchainName                |             The unique identification of the private chain             |
|                Signature algorithm                | ECkey(Secp256k1) or SM2  |

### Genesis account

The genesis account includes a Blackhole account by default and must contain at least one genesis account to ensure that transactions can be made on the private chain.

The required fields include:

### Node Details

Click `details` to view the details of the node.

### Edit node

On the node details page, users can click `Edit` to edit nodes that are not deployed. After the node is deployed, editing operations will not be available.

### Delete node

On the node details page, users can click `Delete` to delete nodes that are not deployed. After the node is deployed, the deletion operation will not be available.

When the last node is deleted, it means that the current chain is deleted and the system will automatically switch to the home page, pending the user to re-initialize the chain information.

## Configuration

Configuration is to modify the configuration file of node deployment. In order to facilitate quick operation, node configuration will be divided into quick configuration (more frequently modified configuration information) and custom configuration (all of the configuration information).

You can learn the field details of configuration file by [main_net_config.conf](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tron-deployment/blob/master/main_net_config.conf).

### Quick config

Quick configuration can only modify the node's HTTP port and RPC port, while other configuration items use the default configuration, the specific configuration items can be explained in the custom configuration.

## One-Click Deployment

### Launch Nodes

TRON FACTORY only support deploy all nodes at one time. Users can choose to deploy a single node or check multiple nodes for batch deployment. 

After clicking `Deploy`, fill in the path of the locally compiled java-tron deployment package to start node deployment. See [depolyment document](https://tronprotocol.github.io/documentation-en/developers/deployment/) to learn how to compile java-tron and generate deployment files.

After the deployment, all nodes will be deployed in sequence, and after the deployment, you can click `log` to view the corresponding deployment result, after successful deployment, the node status will change from stopped to running.

### Node start/stop

After successful deployment, you can perform stop and continue operations on the node.

Click `Stop`, the node will stop producing blocks. A stopped node has the option to continue or redeploy. If you click `Start`, the node will continue to produce blocks and the history of blocks will remain; if you click `Deploy`, the node will be redeployed and the history of blocks will be cleared.

### Node reset

After the node is stopped, users can click `Reset` to reset the node. At this time, the node configuration information will be reset to the default configuration, the node's historical production block information will be cleared, the node can only be redeployed and no longer supports start/stop operation.

### Logs

Click `Log` to view the log for the current node.
